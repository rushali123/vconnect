We plan to make a small token embedded with a QR Code which is linked to one's Aadhaar Number .
At the same time we intend to include their medical history(insurance details) along with  emergency contacts in their Aadhaar which can only 
be accessed by authorised personnel.
This token will be embedded on every citizen's body from the time of their
first vaccination and can't
be removed or damaged.This will benefit unidentified accident victims, providing them with proper immediate healthcare.
